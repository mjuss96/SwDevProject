# SwDevProject
Software Development Application Project (OAMK/OUAS 2018)

We created ATM/Bank simulator using QTCreator. The base idea was same for each group, all the functionalities and requirements were defined.
Every team added 1-2 own new functionalities, we added functionality to draw out foreign currencies. 

I was responsible for database, so i created MySQL database and DLL for database operations.
